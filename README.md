## Features

- **Interactive Q&A**: Engage with the content by asking questions directly to the AI.

## How It Works

### Client-Side

The client-side is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a seamless user interface for interacting with learning materials.

### Server-Side

The server-side, written in Python using Flask, consists of three main files:

- **app.py**: Manages the core functionality including content processing, flashcard generation, and interactive Q&A.
- **constants.py**: Contains predefined templates for exercises and flashcards.
- **utils.py**: Provides utility functions for handling AI models and content processing.
